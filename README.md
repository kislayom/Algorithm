**Problem Statement: **

>A bakery used to base the price of their produce on an individual item cost. So if a customer ordered 10
>cross buns then they would be charged 10x the cost of single bun. The bakery has decided to start
>selling their produce prepackaged in bunches and charging the customer on a per pack basis. So if the
>shop sold vegemite scroll in packs of 3 and 5 and a customer ordered 8 they would get a pack of 3 and
>a pack of 5. The bakery currently sells the following products:

>**Name Code Packs**

>**Vegemite Scroll VS5 3 @ $6.99**

>5 @ $8.99

>**Blueberry Muffin MB11 2 @ $9.95**

>5 @ $16.95

>8 @ $24.95

>**Croissant CF 3 @ $5.95**

>5 @ $9.95

>9 @ $16.99
